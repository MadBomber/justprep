# Justprep

Just a pre-processor to the "just" and "run" task runners.

This directory is the Ruby gem implementation.  There is also a Crystal implementation that is available in the  [MadBomber/justprep Github repository](https://github.com/MadBomber/justprep)


## Installation

    $ gem install justprep

## Documentation

Since this capability is implemented in both Ruby and Crystal there is only one set of documentation.  Both implementations act the same way.  See the [repository's Wiki](https://github.com/MadBomber/justprep/wiki) for details.


## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/[USERNAME]/justprep.
